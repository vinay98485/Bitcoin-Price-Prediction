# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

# Overview

Bitcoin is one of the most volatile digital assets in the world. Predicting its price direction is a challenging task that requires analyzing historical data, market sentiment, and technical indicators.

This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to forecast Bitcoin price movements. While no model can guarantee exact future prices, ML can help us identify patterns, trends, and directional insights that guide better decision-making.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. Build a machine learning model to predict Bitcoin price direction.
2. Reduce irrelevant features using Subspace Learning (SPCE) for better accuracy.
3. Compare multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, ARIMA) to evaluate performance.
4. Store and retrieve Bitcoin historical data securely using Blockchain technology.

# Technology Used

1. Programming Language: Python 3.7+
2. Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib
3. Data Source: Bitcoin historical price data stored via Blockchain
4. Operating System: Windows/Linux/Mac

# Workflow

1. Load Bitcoin data from Blockchain
2. Preprocess dataset
3. Apply SPCE for feature selection
4. Train models (Logistic Regression, SVM, ARIMA)
5. Evaluate accuracy using train/test split (80/20)
6. Compare predicted vs actual prices

# Results

1. Logistic Regression consistently produced the most accurate predictions.
2. SPCE improved model efficiency by removing irrelevant features.
3. Blockchain integration added a layer of security and transparency to data handling.
